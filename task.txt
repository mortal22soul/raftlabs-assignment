Software Dev Intern - Assessment
​
Project Overview:
Your task is to create a server-side rendered (SSR) React-based website using
Next.js. The website should be designed for SEO optimization, with programmatic
SEO pages that are generated dynamically based on the data you select. The
website should look beautiful and adhere to SEO best practices such as using
JSON-LD schema, SEO-friendly titles and descriptions, and OpenGraph metadata.
You will need to:
1.​ Choose a type of data (e.g., sports, finance, etc.).
2.​ Use that data to create SEO-friendly pages.
3.​ Perform keyword research and apply SEO best practices.
4.​ Ensure that the website is server-side rendered for SEO purposes.
5.​ Deploy the site on Vercel, Netlify, or another platform.
6.​ Share a public Git repository and provide a Loom video walkthrough.
Assessment Tasks:
1. Project Setup
●​ Objective: Set up the project using Next.js to enable server-side rendering
(SSR) for SEO optimization.
●​ Deliverables:
○​ Create a Next.js project setup with React, ensuring server-side
rendering (SSR) is configured correctly for SEO optimization.
○​Organize your project with appropriate folder structures for
components, pages, and assets.
2. Data Selection
●​ Objective: Research and choose a type of data that you will use to generate
programmatic SEO pages.
●​ Deliverables:
○​ Provide a brief explanation of the data you chose (e.g., sports
statistics, financial data, etc.).
○​ Find a source for your data (public APIs, datasets, or other
resources).
○​ Describe how the data is structured and how you will use it to
generate dynamic pages.
3. SEO Optimization & Keyword Research
●​ Objective: Conduct keyword research and implement SEO best practices.
●​ Deliverables:
○​ Research relevant keywords for the data you’ve selected (e.g.,
“soccer player stats,” “stock market data”).
○​ Use tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ubersuggest to identify
keywords.
○​ Explain the research process and how you selected your target
keywords.
○​ Implement SEO best practices like using proper meta tags, titles,
descriptions, and OpenGraph tags for social media sharing.​
4. Building Programmatic SEO Pages with SSR
●​ Objective: Create server-side rendered pages using Next.js and dynamic
data.
●​ Deliverables:
○​ Use Next.js’ getServerSideProps to fetch data on the server and
render pages with SEO optimization.
○​ Generate at least 3 SEO-friendly pages based on the data (e.g.,
player profiles for sports data, stock reports for financial data).
○​ Include SEO features such as:
■​ Dynamic title and description tags.
■​ Use JSON-LD schema to structure data in a machine-readable
format.
■​ Implement OpenGraph metadata for social media optimization
(e.g., title, image, description).
■​ Ensure pages are properly indexed by search engines with
proper meta tags.
5. Design and UI/UX
●​ Objective: Build a clean, visually appealing UI that’s also SEO-friendly.
●​ Deliverables:
○​ Create a responsive and user-friendly UI for displaying the data (e.g.,
tables, cards, charts).
○​ Ensure the design is mobile-friendly, with proper accessibility
considerations.
○​ Implement client-side features like filtering or pagination if necessary
to improve the user experience.
6. Deployment
●​ Objective: Deploy the website on a cloud platform like Vercel, Netlify, or
any similar service.
●​ Deliverables:
○​ Deploy the site to Vercel, Netlify, or any cloud hosting service.
○​ Provide the live URL for us to review and test the application.
7. Testing and Debugging
●​ Objective: Ensure that the pages load correctly and are SEO-optimized.
●​ Deliverables:
○​ Test the website to ensure it renders correctly with server-side data.
○​ Use tools like Google’s Lighthouse to check the SEO score and
performance of your site.
○​ Debug and resolve any issues related to rendering, SEO, or
performance.
Required Deliverables:
To be considered for an interview, please submit the following:
1.​ Git Repository:​
Share a public Git repository URL with the complete code for your project.
Ensure that the code is properly organized, and include clear instructions
for running the application locally.
2.​ Hosted Application:​
Deploy your website to Vercel, Netlify, or another cloud platform and
provide the URL where we can access and test the live application.
3.​ Loom Video Walkthrough:​
